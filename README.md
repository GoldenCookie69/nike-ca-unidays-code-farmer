# nike-ca-unidays-code-farmer

A farmer I created to be prepared to checkout new sneakers on release day with 10% off on multiple pairs on Nike Canada since Unidays has a 1 hour cooldown when generating new codes. It will auto-create new codes every hour and save them in "unidays.txt". Note that the codes typically expire after approximately 1 month.
