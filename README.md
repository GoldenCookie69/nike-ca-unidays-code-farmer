## About
A script I made to be prepared to checkout new sneakers on release day with 10% off on multiple pairs on Nike Canada since Unidays has a 1 hour cooldown when generating new codes. It will auto-create new codes every hour and save them in "unidays.txt". Note that the codes typically expire after approximately 1 month. On release day, there will be a ton of codes waiting to be used, maximizing savings for Canadian shoppers looking to purchase multiple pairs of sneakers.

## Usage
Add your email and password in settings.txt and run the main.py file. Pretty straightforward.
